This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router concerning nested layouts and dynamic routes.  The issue occurs when dynamic segments in the route are not correctly propagated to nested layout components, resulting in missing props or unexpected rendering behavior.  The `bug.jsx` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.jsx` provides a solution using context or alternative routing strategies.
