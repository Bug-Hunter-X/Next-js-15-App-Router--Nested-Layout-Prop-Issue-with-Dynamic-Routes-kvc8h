In Next.js 15, the use of the `app` directory introduces a potential edge case where a component's layout might not be correctly applied when using dynamic routing segments and nested layouts.  This can happen if the dynamic segment is not correctly interpreted within the nested layout's structure, leading to unexpected rendering behavior.  For example, if a layout is expecting a specific prop from a page component, it might not receive it if the dynamic route is not properly passed down.
