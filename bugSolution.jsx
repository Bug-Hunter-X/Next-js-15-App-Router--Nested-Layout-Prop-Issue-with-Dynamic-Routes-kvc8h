To solve this, you can employ several techniques: 

1. **Context API:** Pass the dynamic route segment down through the component tree using the Context API. This ensures the data is accessible to all nested layouts.

2. **Alternative Routing:** Consider restructuring your routing to simplify the nested layout structure, removing the complexity around dynamic segments within the nested hierarchy.

3. **Prop Drilling (Less Ideal):** As a less elegant solution, explicitly pass the dynamic segment as props down through each nested layout component.  This can become cumbersome with deeply nested structures.

The `bugSolution.jsx` demonstrates the Context API approach, which offers a cleaner and more maintainable solution for handling dynamic segments in nested layouts.
